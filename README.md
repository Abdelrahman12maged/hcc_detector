üöÄ Exciting News! Introducing My Graduation Project: An AI-Powered HCC Diagnosis Application! üß†üì≤
We are thrilled to unveil our latest project: an innovative desktop application designed to assist doctors in diagnosing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) using AI technology. This project is the culmination of our hard work and dedication as part of our graduation requirements.
üåü Key Features:
AI Model for HCC Detection: We developed an AI model trained on real CT images from Al-Rajhi Liver Hospital in Assiut, ensuring our model is robust and reliable.
Real Data Utilization: Our model has been trained on genuine medical data, enhancing its accuracy and effectiveness in diagnosing HCC.
Flutter Framework: The application is built using Flutter, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience across various devices.
State-of-the-Art Libraries: We leveraged powerful libraries and packages in Flutter to create an efficient and user-friendly interface.
Simplified Diagnosis Process: This tool assists doctors in identifying HCC cases, especially in challenging scenarios where CT images alone may not be conclusive. The AI's perspective adds a new dimension to the diagnostic process, complementing the human eye.
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview:
Frontend: Developed using Flutter, known for its cross-platform capabilities and smooth performance.
Backend: The backend is powered by a sophisticated AI model implemented in PyTorch, a leading framework for deep learning.
Integration: Our application seamlessly integrates the AI model with the Flutter frontend, ensuring real-time processing and results.
This application is a game-changer in the medical field, providing doctors with an advanced tool to enhance their diagnostic accuracy and speed. By leveraging AI, we aim to improve patient outcomes and support healthcare professionals in their critical work.
We are excited about the potential impact this project can have on medical diagnostics and look forward to your feedback.
