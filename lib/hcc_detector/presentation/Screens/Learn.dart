The disease is typically asymptomatic in its early stages, leading to late diagnosis and poor prognosis.\n\n Common symptoms at advanced stages include abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, jaundice, and liver enlargement.Diagnosis of HCC involves a combination of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with serum biomarkers like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Histological confirmation through liver biopsy is sometimes required.\n\nTreatment options for HCC depend on the stage of the disease and the underlying liver function. They include surgical resection, liver transplantation, local ablative therapies (e.g., radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), systemic therapies (e.g., sorafenib, lenvatinib), and emerging immunotherapies. Despite advances in treatment, the overall prognosis for HCC remains poor, emphasizing the importance of early detection and preventive strategies such as vaccination for HBV and antiviral treatment for HBV and HCV infections.\n\nResearch into the molecular pathogenesis of HCC is ongoing, aiming to uncover novel therapeutic targets and improve patient outcomes. Public health initiatives focused on screening high-risk populations and reducing the prevalence of liver disease are crucial in the global fight against hepatocellular carcinoma.',
